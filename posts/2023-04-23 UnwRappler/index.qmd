<h1>About</h1>
<div class='executive-summary'>

Original creation and submission for this notebook was last July 2019. 

This was a final project for the Data Mining & Wrangling course. In this final project, we were tasked to create an end-to-end project - from project proposal, data colletion & wranling, model building, and presentation of results and insights. For this project, articles from the [Rappler Website](https://www.rappler.com/) were analyzed to see if there were underlying themes in the website's article portfolio. Below is the detailed technical paper with an attached executive summary.

This analysis was done together with my groupmates George Esleta, Carmelita Esclanda, and Elmer Robles.
