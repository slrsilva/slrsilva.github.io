abstract = {Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an ongoing field of research in text mining field. SA is the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text. This survey paper tackles a comprehensive overview of the last update in this field. Many recently proposed algorithms' enhancements and various SA applications are investigated and presented briefly in this survey. These articles are categorized according to their contributions in the various SA techniques. The related fields to SA (transfer learning, emotion detection, and building resources) that attracted researchers recently are discussed. The main target of this survey is to give nearly full image of SA techniques and the related fields with brief details. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas.}

abstract="We describe a semi-automated system to assist law enforcement and intelligence agencies dealing with cyber-crime related to promotion of hate and radicalization on the Internet. The focus of this work is on mining YouTube to discover hate videos, users and virtual hidden communities. Finding precise information on YouTube is a challenging task because of the huge size of the YouTube repository and a large subscriber base. We present a solution based on data mining and social network analysis (using a variety of relationships such as friends, subscriptions, favorites and related videos) to aid an analyst in discovering insightful and actionable information. Furthermore, we performed a systematic study of the features and properties of the data and hidden social networks which has implications in understanding extremism on Internet. We take a case study based approach and perform empirical validation of the proposed hypothesis. Our approach succeeded in finding hate videos which were validated manually.",
