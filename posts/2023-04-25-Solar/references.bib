abstract = {Prediction of solar irradiance is essential for minimizing energy costs and providing high power quality in electrical power grids with distributed solar photovoltaic generations. However, for residential and small commercial users deploying on-site photovoltaic generations, the historical irradiance data can not be obtained directly because of expensive solar irradiance meters. Thanks to increasingly improved weather forecasting service provided by local meteorological organizations, weather forecasting data such as temperature, dew point, humidity, visibility, wind speed and descriptive weather summary, are becoming readily available through the Internet, while the irradiance forecasting data are often unavailable. This paper proposes a novel solar prediction scheme for hourly day-ahead solar irradiance prediction by using the weather forecasting data. This study formulates the prediction problem as a structured output prediction problem jointly predicting multiple outputs simultaneously. The proposed prediction model is trained by using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks taking into account the dependence between consecutive hours of the same day. We compare persistence algorithm, linear least square regression and multilayered feedforward neural networks using backpropagation algorithm (BPNN) for solar irradiance prediction. The experimental results on a dataset collected in island of Santiago, Cape Verde, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms these competitive algorithms for single output prediction. The proposed algorithm is %18.34 more accurate than BPNN in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) by using about 2 years training data to predict half-year testing data. Moreover, compared with BPNN, the proposed algorithm also shows less overfitting and better generalization capability. For a case using 10 years of historical data to predict 1 year of irradiance data, the prediction RMSE using the proposed LSTM algorithm decreases by 42.9% against BPNN.}

abstract = {Accurate photovoltaic power forecasting is of great help to the operation of photovoltaic power generation system. However, due to the instability, intermittence, and randomness of solar energy, accurate prediction of photovoltaic power forecasting becomes very difficult. In this paper, the convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and hybrid model based on convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network models were proposed, and are applied to the obtained data in DKASC, Alice Springs photovoltaic system. The mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and mean absolute error indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the prediction model in this paper. The results showed that when the input sequence is increased, the accuracy of the model is also improved, and the prediction effect of the hybrid model is the best, followed by that of convolutional neural network. While long short-term memory network had the worst prediction effect, the training time was the shortest. However, not the longer the input sequence is, the better the prediction will be. This may be related to the characteristics of the time series itself. The results of the deep learning model proposed in this paper on photovoltaic power prediction also indicate that deep learning is very helpful for improving the accuracy of PV power prediction.}

abstract = {Solar photovoltaic plants are widely integrated into most countries worldwide. Due to the ever-growing utilization of solar photovoltaic plants, either via grid-connection or stand-alone networks, dramatic changes can be anticipated in both power system planning and operating stages. Solar photovoltaic integration requires the capability of handling the uncertainty and fluctuations of power output. In this case, solar photovoltaic power forecasting is a crucial aspect to ensure optimum planning and modelling of the solar photovoltaic plants. Accurate forecasting provides the grid operators and power system designers with significant information to design an optimal solar photovoltaic plant as well as managing the power of demand and supply. This paper presents an extensive review on recent advancements in the field of solar photovoltaic power forecasting. This paper aims to analyze and compare various methods of solar photovoltaic power forecasting in terms of characteristics and performance. This work classifies solar photovoltaic power forecasting methods into three major categories i.e., time-series statistical methods, physical methods, and ensemble methods. To date, Artificial Intelligence approaches are widely used due to their capability in solving the non-linear and complex structure of data. The performance analysis shows that these methods outperform the traditional methods. Recently, the ensemble methods were also developed by researchers to extract the unique features of single models to enhance the forecast model performances. This combination produces accurate results compared to individual models. This paper also elaborates on the metrics assessment which was implemented to evaluate the forecast model performances. This work provides information which is beneficial for researchers and engineers who are involved in the modelling and planning of the solar photovoltaic plant.}

abstract = {Forecasting the AC power output of a PV plant accurately is important both for plant owners and electric system operators. Two main categories of PV modeling are available: the parametric and the nonparametric. In this paper, a methodology using a nonparametric PV model is proposed, using as inputs several forecasts of meteorological variables from a Numerical Weather Forecast model, and actual AC power measurements of PV plants. The methodology was built upon the R environment and uses Quantile Regression Forests as machine learning tool to forecast AC power with a confidence interval. Real data from five PV plants was used to validate the methodology, and results show that daily production is predicted with an absolute cvMBE lower than 1.3%.}
