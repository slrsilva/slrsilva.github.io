<h2> Hello, World! </h2>
<p class='aboutme'>
This website will be where I share my journey of mastering the art and science of data science and analytics, showcasing my past projects, and writing about the topics that I find truly fascinating. So, please stay tuned and let's explore this exciting world together!
</p>

<h2> About Me </h2>
<div class='aboutme'>
With over 8 years of experience in the energy and financial industries as an Analytics Officer, I have a proven track record of developing portfolio optimization tools, conducting financial and risk analysis, and providing data-driven recommendations. Through my proficiency in Python and other data analytics tools, I have streamlined data collection, mining, and wrangling, developed data-informed suggestions and reports, and successfully communicated my insights to a range of stakeholders. 


My career has been focused on solving complex multidisciplinary problems, and I have developed a strong interest in data science as a tool to solve real-world business and policy problems. I am actively pursuing opportunities to utilize and enhance my data science and analytical skills, with a focus on improving business analytics and data science practices.
