In this final project, we were tasked to create an end-to-end project - from project proposal, data colletion & wranling, model building, and presentation of results and insights. For this project, articles from the [Rappler Website](https://www.rappler.com/) were analyzed to see if there were underlying themes in the website's article portfolio. Below is the detailed technical paper with an attached executive summary.\n</div>\n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\nThis analysis was done together with my groupmates George Esleta, Carmelita Esclanda, and Elmer Robles.\n\n<h2>Technical Paper</h2>\n\n<iframe\n    width='1200'\n    height='900'\n    src=\"source/DMW - LT01 - Tech Paper.pdf\">\n</iframe>\n\n",
