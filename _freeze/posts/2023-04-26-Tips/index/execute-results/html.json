Yu\n\nOriginal creation and submission of this report was last Dec 2019.\n\n## Abstract {#sec-executivesummary}\n\n<div class='executive-summary'>\nYellow cabs, green cabs, For-Hire Vehicles such as those operated by Uber and Lyft, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles are registered and regulated by the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission. This agency is also in charge of creating policy that affect the operators, commuters, and drivers. Current initiatives are trying to provide better working conditions and wages to FHV drivers since operators often take advantage of them, but there are no new policies that target the improvement of yellow taxi drivers, who work 12 hours a day and barely make minimum wage. This study aims to answer the problem \"what are the best pickup locations to maximize tips of yellow taxi cab drivers\" to help them maximize additional earnings in tips.\n\nThe data used in this study, yellow cab trip data in 2018 (8.65 GB), is a subset of the TLC data available in the AWS open data registry whose S3 bucket is `s3://nyc-tlc/trip data/`. Additional data from the Taxi Zone Lookup file was used to identify the boroughs and zones. An exploratory data analysis to conduct initial observations and identify potential trends or patterns in the data was performed. This was followed by data cleaning and preparation to ensure the data was ready for analysis. The study used machine learning algorithms, specifically the XGBoost algorithm, to predict the tips received by yellow taxi drivers based on pickup location, time of day, and other factors. The results of the study identified several pickup locations that could help maximize tips for yellow taxi drivers. The findings of this study could help improve the earnings of yellow taxi drivers who often struggle to make a living wage.\n</div>\n<!-- ![](source-files/Poster.png){width=80% fig-align=\"center\"} -->\n\n## Introduction and Significance {#sec-introduction}\n\nThe New York Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating yellow taxi cabs, green cabs, For-Hire Vehicles (FHVs), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. Technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enchancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP) collected trip data and shared it to TLC. This data is often used for policy and decision making to consider and reflect observed changes in the industry.\n\nOne of the datasets, aside from FHV and greeb cab trip data, is the yellow cab trip records from January 2009 to June 2019. The data used in this study is a subset, yellow cab trip data in 2018, which amounts to 8.65 GB.\n\nThe goal of this study is to answer the problem \"what are the best pickup locations to maximize tips of yellow taxi cab drivers\". Once the optimal locations and possibly other factors that affect tip amount are identified, yellow cab drivers can make better decisions, such as where to wait for passengers, to maximize the tip they generate per day.\n\n\nThe significance of this statement lies in the potential impact it could have on the daily earnings and livelihoods of yellow taxi cab drivers in New York City. Many yellow cab drivers struggle to make a living wage, and maximizing tips could be an important factor in improving their financial well-being. By identifying the optimal pickup locations and other factors that affect tip amounts, this study could help yellow cab drivers make more informed decisions about where to wait for passengers, ultimately leading to higher tips and increased earnings. Additionally, the findings of this study could inform policy and decision-making by the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission to improve the working conditions and wages of yellow cab drivers, ensuring a fair and equitable industry for all involved.\n\n\n## Methodology {#sec-methodology}\n\n### Data Collection and Description {#sec-datacollection}\nThe Yellow Taxi Dataset of the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission was retrieved from the [AWS open data registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/) by accessing its [S3 bucket](s3://nyc-tlc/trip data/). Dataset was stored monthly in a `.csv` format, and contains the following information:\n\n|**Column Name**|**Description**|**Values**|\n|:----------|:---------------|:---------|\n|VendorID|TPEP provider|1: Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC.<br>2: VeriFone, Inc.|\n|tpep_pickup_datetime|Date and time the meter was engaged to signify start of trip|Datetime|\n|tpep_dropoff_datetime|Date and time the meter was disengaged to signify end of trip|Datetime|\n|Passenger_count|Number of passengers during the trip.
